The first step in our workflow when working on a new project is to fork the canonical repository. This creates a copy of the repository that is specific to your user on GitHub. Everyone that is working on the project has their own fork of the repository where they can safely make changes without impacting the main code or other contributor's code.

----
**Action:** Fork this repo!

1. Open the main repository page, `https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-gitflows-[username]`.
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right (see image below).

3. If prompted with `Where should we fork ...`, choose your user account.
4. When it is complete, you should be on a new webpage. Instead of `USGS-R/ds-gitflows-[username]`, you will now see `[username]/ds-gitflows-[username]` at the top.

Congratulations! You've made your own copy of the main repository. Close this issue and proceed to the next one.
