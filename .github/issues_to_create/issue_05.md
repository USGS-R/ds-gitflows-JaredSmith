You are now ready to start contributing your own content to the project! Normally, you would be adding new files, editing lines of code, etc; however, to keep this tutorial programming language-agnostic, we will be editing text in a Markdown document. I think you have already learned about Markdown but if not, visit [this quick article](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to learn about it.

We will be using the `dryville_story.md` file to illustrate changes to a repository. First, you will make a change and then save it with Git.

----
**Action:** Add text to the story and commit your change.

1. Before we make any changes, let's check that we are starting from a clean slate. Run `git status` in Git Bash in your project directory. You should see a message that says "nothing to commit". This means that there are no changes on your local copy and it exactly matches the content on your remote fork (the `origin` repo). This is good!
1. Now, open the `dryville_story.md` file on your computer. Any text editor will do, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). Currently, there is a title (denoted by `#`) and two sub-headers (denoted by `##`) with text. You can also see the syntax for hyperlinks, `[text that appears](link/to/the/website)`. To see how this syntax is rendered on GitHub, open the `dryville_story.md` file on GitHub by going to the main repo (`https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-gitflows-[username]`) and clicking the file name.
1. Now, we will add the next section of the story (we are recreating the story available [here on the USGS Water Science School](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/story-water-dryville)). Open that link. The next section in the story that we don't have in our file yet is called "Getting Water to Your Homes". Add the title (use `##`), the body text, and the appropriate link for the words "over 8 pounds a gallon" to the `dryville_story.md` file locally. Save the file.
1. Now, we have made a change in our local repo. If you run `git status` in Git Bash, you should see the words "modified: dryville_story.md". This means that Git detects a new change. At this point, you could run `git diff` to visually see the changes you made: red = original, green = changed (if you do this and see a `:` at the bottom of your bash window, type `q` to get out of the diff view before proceeding). You will also see the words "no changes added to commit". This is because we have not told Git to record these changes; we have not "staged" them. 
1. We now need to stage these changes so that they can be included in our commit. To stage our changes, run `git add dryville_story.md`. Now when you run `git status`, you see that the "modified: dryville_story.md" change is listed under "Changes to be committed". We are now ready to make a commit.
1. To make a commit, run `git commit -m "[insert your message here]"`. For this change, we will run `git commit -m "add getting-water-to-your-homes section"`. Any change that was listed under the "Changes to be committed" section when we ran `git status` will be included in this commit.
1. Run `git status` again. We should be back to where we started. There is "nothing to commit" because we don't have any additional changes to the repository content - we already committed our only changes. However, you will also see that it says "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit". We'll talk about that later.

You have now made a commit and recorded your changes with Git! Close this issue and move on to the next one.
