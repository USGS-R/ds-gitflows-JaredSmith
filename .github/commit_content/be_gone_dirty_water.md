## Be Gone, Dirty Water

One night you again sit down to a dinner of fresh-caught catfish — don't forget to wash your hands in the water bucket after cleaning those stinky fish! And those dirty dishes, just wash them in the bucket, too. Then get rid of that smelly bucket of water —just throw it out in the yard. But your neighbor complains about having to smell rotten fish all night, and you complain to him about the water they wash their dirty clothes in finding its way to your front step. And then there's that hole your neighbor dug for his toilet — well, use your imagination.

It seems that there is something more to life than just getting and using water — you need to get rid of your wastewater. You need to build a "water-return system," commonly known as a sewer network. Again, lay a network of pipes from your homes back downhill. Connect your sinks, baths, and toilets to the pipes to take away unwanted water. Run the pipes back into the creek (downstream from your water-intake pump!) and let the creek carry away your waste water.

You're happy until the Hewlett family downstream starts complaining about your raw sewage flowing in the creek beside their home. You realize you need to send the waste water from your house to some place where you can clean it up before putting it back in the creek. You build a [sewage-treatment plant](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/wastewater-treatment-water-use-united-states), run pipes from the town's houses to it, and begin treating wastewater before releasing it into Dryville Creek.
